Welcome to thefrvrplaylist! My name is Martin, and for several years now, I have been recording, producing, and engineering my own original music. I felt a strong connection to music around the age of 10, when I began playing the alto saxophone and clarinet in my school band. Music had a special way to uplift my spirits, and a few years later, I began creating my own, originally favoring hip-hop but later finding my lane with R&B music, which is now my favorite genre.

More recently, I have discovered the passion I have for music is deeper than just creating it. During my free time, when I am not working on my own music, in class achieving my bachelor’s degree in business, at work, where I am a computer repair technician, or working on designing original clothes, I am listening to music. I found that I can talk about music I am into for days, and with the help of my best friend, I decided to create this blog where I will be reviewing new music, showcasing my favorite albums I’m listening to, and just sharing music I like in general. Please feel free to send me recommendations at my email!

Enjoy!
