I felt a strong connection to music around the age of 10, when I began playing the alto saxophone and clarinet in my school band. Music had a special way to uplift my spirits, and a few years later, I began creating my own, originally favoring hip-hop but later finding my lane with R&B music, which is now my favorite genre."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"category":"Gatsby"}}
